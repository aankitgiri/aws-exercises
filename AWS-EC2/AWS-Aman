Amazon S3 is a durable, secure, simple, and fast storage service designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.We use Amazon S3 if you need low latency or frequent access to your data.We use Amazon Glacier if low storage cost is paramount, your data is rarely retrieved, and data retrieval times of several hours are acceptable.

Amazon S3 now provides a new storage option that enables you to utilize Amazon Glacierâ€™s extremely low-cost storage service for data archiving. You can define S3 lifeycycle rules to automatically archive sets of Amazon S3 objects to Amazon Glacier to reduce your storage costs.
